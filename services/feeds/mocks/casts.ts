The reason for the failure is that getProposePrice can no longer obtain data after createProposal is called. I will ask tomorrow whether the contract is reasonable.\n- I will continue to finish the front-end tomorrow. The challenge needs to add an optional payment amount component, and some operational feedback needs to be processed.",
